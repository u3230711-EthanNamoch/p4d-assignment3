# p4d-assignment3
 This project is coded by Ethan Namoch for the Programing for Design unit.

# Overview
This project is a one-page site that aims to promote Covid-19 Vaccine Facts from the World Health Organization and ACT Health.

# Reflection
Due to a hectic schedule, I have managed to do at least the bare minimum of the project. Honestly, I wish I had more time to pursue its interaction and dynamics using various javascript techniques, but I have ran out of time.

# Final Words
If there are problems or issues with the project, please do not hesitate to contact me via student email - u3230711@uni.canberra.edu.au
