            <p>Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. 
                Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself. Regardless of whether the vaccine is 
                made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the 
                disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first 
                reaction to the actual pathogen.
            <br><br>
            Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived 
            antibodies and development of memory cells. In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism, building 
            up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.
            <br><br>
            When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease. But not everyone can be vaccinated. 
            People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some 
            vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines. These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst 
            others who are vaccinated. When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the 
            people it encounters are immune. So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines 
            are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens. This is called herd immunity.
            <br><br>
            This is especially important for those people who not only can’t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against. 
            No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who cannot safely be vaccinated. But 
            with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated.
            <br><br>
            Vaccinating not only protects yourself, but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated. If you are able to, get vaccinated.

          WHO ADVICES THE COVID-19 VACCINES?

        <img src="assets/images/pexels-edward-jenner-4031418.jpg" alt="From Pexels - Edward Jenner" class="who__img">
        
        <div class="who__body">
            <p><strong>COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL are safe for most people 18 years and older,</strong> including those with pre-existing conditions, including auto-immune disorders. 
                These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>If you are pregnant, want to get pregnant in the future or are currently breastfeeding,</strong> getting vaccinated is important to protect you and your current or future 
                family. Many people around the world have now been vaccinated against COVID-19 while pregnant or breastfeeding, and no safety concerns have been identified for 
                them or their babies. In fact, getting vaccinated while pregnant helps to protect your baby; this may also be the case if you get vaccinated while breastfeeding. 
                You should still get vaccinated if you are menstruating on the day of your appointment.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>If you are immunocompromised,</strong> you should be prioritised for an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine after 1 to 3 months. People with compromised 
                immune systems don’t always develop sufficient immunity against COVID-19 after one or two doses, so an additional dose can help to protect them. You should also 
                get a booster dose if recommended. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>There is growing evidence that children can be safely vaccinated against COVID-19.</strong> Check the COVID-19 vaccines Q&A page or the information pages 
                on each vaccine for advice on what age-specific guidance is in place for that vaccine.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>If you are aged 60 and over and are vaccinated with Sinovac or Sinopharm,</strong> you should be offered a third dose after 3 - 6 months.  People over 
                60 have been found to develop less protection after two doses of these vaccines than younger people. Getting a third dose can help provide higher immunity. You 
                should also get a booster dose when it is your turn. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>WHO SHOULD NOT GET VACCINATED?</strong>
                <br><br>
                It is safe for most people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. 
                <br><br>
                However, you should not be vaccinated if:
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine, in order to avoid possible adverse effects.</li>
                    <li>You have a fever over 38.5ºC on the day of your vaccine appointment. Postpone until you have recovered.</li>
                    <li>You currently have confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Wait until you have completed the mandated isolation period and your acute symptoms have passed to get 
                        vaccinated.</li>
                    <li>If you are on blood thinners, it is safe for you to get vaccinated but let the person vaccinating you know.</li>
                </ul>

          <p>Safe and effective vaccines are available that provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Billions of people have been 
            vaccinated against COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself against COVID-19, help end the pandemic and stop new 
            variants emerging.  
            <br><br>
            Take all COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended to you by your health authority as soon as it is your turn, including a booster dose if recommended. It is still possible 
            to get COVID-19 and spread it to others after being vaccinated, so continue to do everything you can to keep yourself and others healthy. Continue keeping a safe 
            distance from others and avoiding crowds, wearing a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, cleaning hands regularly 
            and covering coughs and sneezes. If you do get COVID-19 after vaccination, you are more likely to have mild or no symptoms than if you hadn't been vaccinated. 
            <br><br>
            As of 8 April 2022, WHO has evaluated that the following vaccines against COVID-19 have met the necessary criteria for safety and efficacy: 
            <ul>
                <li>AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine</li>
                <li>Johnson and Johnson</li>
                <li>Moderna</li>
                <li>Pfizer/BionTech</li>
                <li>Sinopharm</li>
                <li>Sinovac</li>
                <li>COVAXIN</li>
                <li>Covovax</li>
                <li>Nuvaxovid</li>
                <li>CanSino</li>
            </ul>         
            Some national regulators have also assessed other COVID-19 vaccine products for use in their countries. Take whatever vaccine is made available to you first, even 
            if you have already had COVID-19. It is important to be vaccinated as soon as possible once it’s your turn and not wait. It is safe and effective to mix-and-match 
            different COVID-19 vaccines.  
            <br><br>
            The current COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness and death caused by the Omicron and Delta variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. 
            Being fully vaccinated will also help reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging.

          <p>Getting vaccinated could save your life. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. There is also some evidence 
            that being vaccinated will make it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around you.
            <br><br>
            Even after getting vaccinated, keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family, friends and anyone else you may come into contact with. COVID-19 vaccines are highly 
            effective, but some people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination. There is also still a chance that you could also pass the virus on to others who are not 
            vaccinated. Stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly 
            ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas 
            where you travel, live and work.
